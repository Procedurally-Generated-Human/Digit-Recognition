# Digit Recognition
Deep learning handwriten digit recogontition. My first ever neural network project.  
The neural network used in this project was created with pytorch and trained with the MNIST dataset. It has an accuracy of about 98% when tested with MNIST, however it has a lower accuracy when recognizing user drawn digits.

- Neural network made with pytorch library
- Trained and tested using MNIST dataset
- Graphical component made with Tkinter
